## Installation Instructions

### Necessary modules

Install these Python modules

    pip install flask
    pip install flask_sqlalchemy
    pip install flask_sqlalchemy
    pip install plotly
    pip install textblob
    pip install rake_nltk
If possible install sqlite3 to access the database

If pip install does not work, try 'pip3 install'

### Running the app

Simply clone the repository and then run app.py and the website should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

    py app.py

If that does not work, try 'python app.py' or 'python3 app.py'

### Using the app

Running the app will bring you to the homepage.

From there you will have the option to Register, Login, Create a session, Join a session or go to the user homepage (which shows all sessions currently joined both as a host and attendee)

A session can be joined without logging in, all you need is the session code.
However login is required to host a session or access the user homepage.

Once you host a session you will see the session code on the screen and from there it's just about receiving and looking at feedback.

You can see an example of a running session as a host by logging in with username "John Smith" and password "pass" and joining the session "Life Lessons With John Smith" where you can see past feedback and add questions to the session.

If you wish to enter that session as a attendee, just join a session from the Join Session page with code "D1H4LSOL"
